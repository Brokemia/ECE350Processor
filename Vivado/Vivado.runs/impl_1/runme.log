WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 ProcMem/MemoryArray_reg_0 has an input control pin ProcMem/MemoryArray_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: ProcMem/ADDRARDADDR[7]) which is driven by a register (CPU/LatchXM_O/genblk1[7].RegBit/q_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
